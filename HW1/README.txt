The objective of this assignment is a simple refresher on memory allocations and deallocations using C while avoiding resource leaks.

(all below is from the initial submission of the assignment for class) 

This package includes the following files.

|-- Driver.c [This is the driver program which will be used to invoke the MemoryManager.]
|-- MemoryManager.c [MemoryManager is implemented here.]
|-- MemoryManager.h [Header file declaring the function exposed from MemoryManager]
|-- README.txt [This file]

To compile:
    gcc *.c

To run:
    ./a.out <seed>

For example;
    ./a.out 1234

Hi, I feel like my code is quite self explanatory and I didn't have many hiccups(besides remembering how to print in C lol).
