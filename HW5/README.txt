The objective of this assignment is to get you comfortable with different CPU scheduling algorithms. You will be implementing multiple scheduling algorithms some with support for preemption while tracking measures of scheduling effectiveness.

This assignment I did not do well on but was a simple implementation error of the algorithms. I believe I just didn't schedule the algorithms when they were coming in, and I instead shceduled them all at once.

(all below was written for the initial submission, this professor asked us to share are thoughts + clarify things in our code)


I wrote this assignment in C++, which took some getting back into. I haven't done it since highschool:). 
I am not getting the exact answers as the given ones but I'm not sure exactly what's wrong. 
In my zip i have the two test examples given, sorry if I was not supposed to leave them in.
